Analyze the following comments and identify the main recurring themes.
Your goal is to produce a **balanced list of 10 to 17 broad topics** that effectively summarize the key ideas expressed in the comments — without going into excessive detail.

---

### Guidelines

1. **Language Consistency**

   * All topic names must be written in the same language as the comments.
   * The language of the comments is **{{language}}**.

2. **Topic Naming**

   * Use **short, general titles (3–4 words)**, as if they were **Wikipedia page titles**.
   * Keep each title **clear, self-contained, and non-redundant**.

3. **Concept Boundaries**

   * **Do not merge unrelated ideas** (e.g., avoid “Equal Pay and Visibility”).
   * Each topic should cover **one coherent concept** only.
   * If two ideas are distinct (e.g., *pay* vs. *visibility*), create **separate topics**.

4. **Topic Scope**

   * Favor **broad, inclusive categories** over narrow or isolated cases.
   * Ensure that topics together provide a **comprehensive, non-overlapping overview** of the comments.
