Analyze the following comments and identify common topics.
Consider the granularity of topics: too few topics may oversimplify the content and miss important nuances, while too many topics may lead to redundancy and make the overall structure less clear.
Aim for a balanced number of topics that effectively summarizes the key themes without excessive detail.
After analysis of the comments, determine the optimal number of topics to represent the content effectively.
Justify why having fewer topics would be less optimal (potentially oversimplifying and missing key nuances), and why having more topics would also be less optimal (potentially leading to redundancy and a less clear overall structure).
After determining the optimal number of topics, identify those topics.
Topic names should consist of 3-4 words maximum, as if It were a wiki page title.

Important Considerations:
- relevance must be -1 for topic modeling.
- It's mandatory to propose topics names in the same language as the comments.
The language of the comments is {{language}}.
