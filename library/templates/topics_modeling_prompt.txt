Based on the topic ‘Women and Industry,’ analyze the following comments and identify common topics.
Generate a list of topics. 
Aim for a balanced number of topics that effectively summarizes the key themes without excessive detail (between 5 and 7 topics).

Important Considerations:

-It's mandatory to propose topics names in the same language as the comments. The language of the comments is {{language}}.

Additional instructions:

- Use shorter, broader topic titles,  3 or 4 words, as if It were a wiki page title.

- Do not merge two unrelated ideas (e.g., avoid “Equal pay and visibility”).

- Each topic should cover a large area, not a very specific case.

- Keep concepts strictly separate  
- If two notions are distinct (pay vs. visibility), create two different topics.

- Add keywords: For each topic, list 3 to 5 relevant keywords.


Example of desired output:
Topic 1: Awareness and Guidance  
Keywords: girls, youth, careers, exploration

Topic 2: Training and Career Development  
Keywords: mentoring, career, training


Topic 3: Working Conditions and Flexibility  
Keywords: leave, maternity, pay, flexibility

Topic 4: Promotion and Visibility  
Keywords: leadership, networks, communication, visibility
(Add other broad topics following the same logic.)
