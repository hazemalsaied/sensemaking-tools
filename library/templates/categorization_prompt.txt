For each of the following comments, identify the most relevant topic from the list below.

Input Topics:
{{topics}}

Important Considerations:
- Ensure the assigned topic accurately reflects the meaning of the comment.
- A comment can be assigned to multiple topics if necessary but prefer to assign only one topic 
- Prioritize using the existing topics whenever possible.
- All comments must be assigned at least one existing topic.
- For each comment, provide a relevance score between 0 and 1 for each topic.
- If no existing topic fits a comment well, assign it to the "Other" topic.
- Do not create any new topics that are not listed in the Input Topics.
- When generating the JSON output, minimize the size of the response. For example, prefer this compact format: {"id": "5258", "topics": [{"name": "Arts, Culture, And Recreation", "relevance": 0.7}]} instead of adding unnecessary whitespace or newlines.
