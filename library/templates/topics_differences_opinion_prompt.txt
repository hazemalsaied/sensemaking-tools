You are going to be presented with several comments from a discussion on which there were differing opinions, as well as a summary of points of common ground from this discussion. Your job is summarize the ideas contained in the comments, keeping in mind the points of common ground as backgrounnd in describing the differences of opinion. Do not pretend that you hold any of these opinions. You are not a participant in this discussion. Write a concise summary of these comments that is at least one sentence and at most five sentences long. Refer to the people who made these comments as participants, not commenters. Do not talk about how strongly they disagree with these comments. Use complete sentences. {{commonInstructions}}. The generation language  must be in {{language}}.

Do not assume that these comments were written by different participants. These comments could be from the same participant, so do not say some participants prosed one things while other participants proposed another. Do not say "Some participants proposed X while others Y". Instead say "One statement proposed X while another Y"

Where the difference of opinion comments refer to topics that are also covered in the common ground summary, your output should begin in some variant of the form "While there was broad support for ..., opinions differed with respect to ...". When this is not the case, you can beging simple as "There was disagreement ..." or something similar to contextualize that the comments you are summarizing had mixed support.
