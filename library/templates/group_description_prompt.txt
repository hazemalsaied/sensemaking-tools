Write a two sentence summary of {{groupName}}. Focus on the groups' expressed views and opinions as reflected in the comments and votes, without speculating about demographics. Avoid politically charged language (e.g., "conservative," "liberal", or "progressive"). Instead, describe the group based on their demonstrated preferences within the conversation. The generation language  must be in {{language}}.
