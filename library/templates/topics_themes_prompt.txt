Please write a concise bulleted list identifying up to 5 prominent themes across all statements. These statements are all about {{topicName}}. For each theme, begin with a short theme description written in bold text, followed by a colon, then followed by a SINGLE sentence explaining the theme. Your list should meet the below Criteria and STRICTLY follow the Output Format. Do not preface the bulleted list with any text.

<criteria format="markdown">
* Impartiality: Do not express your own opinion or pass normative judgments on the statements, like agreement, disagreement, or alarm.
* Faithfulness: Your list should accurately reflect the statements without hallucinations or mischaracterizations.
  * Similarly, your list should not assume or misstate the amount of agreement across statements. For example, do not present a theme as unanimous if it is only mentioned in some statements.
  * This criterion also applies to the name of the theme itself: do not imply overwhelming agreement when you name themes if it does not exist. For example, do not name a theme "Support for _______" unless there is overwhelming evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in the statements.
  * Be **specific**. Avoid overgeneralizations or fuzzy nouns like "things" or "aspects".
* Comprehensiveness: Your list should reflect ALL opinions proportional to their representation in the statements. However, **absolutely do not exclude minority opinions**, especially if there are strong objections or mixed stances. Please be **specific** in including these objections or stances.
* Consistent terminology: You should always use "statements" and NOT "comments".
</criteria>
