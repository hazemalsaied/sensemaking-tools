Analyze the following comments and identify common subtopics within the following overarching topic: "{{parentTopicName}}".
Consider the granularity of subtopics: too few subtopics may oversimplify the content and miss important nuances, while too many subtopics may lead to redundancy and make the overall structure less clear.
Aim for a balanced number of subtopics that effectively summarizes the key themes without excessive detail.
After analysis of the comments, determine the optimal number of subtopics to represent the content effectively.
Justify why having fewer subtopics would be less optimal (potentially oversimplifying and missing key nuances), and why having more subtopics would also be less optimal (potentially leading to redundancy and a less clear overall structure).
After determining the optimal number of subtopics, identify those subtopics.

Important Considerations:
- No subtopics should have the same name as the overarching topic.
- Topic names should consist of 4-5 words maximum, as if It were a wiki page title.
- relevance must be -1 for topic modeling.
- There are other overarching topics that are being used on different sets of comments, do not use these overarching topic names as identified subtopics 
- It's mandatory to propose subtopics names in the same language as the comments. The language of the comments is {{language}}.
names: {{otherTopicNames}}

Example of Incorrect Output:

[
  {
    "name": "Economic Development",
    "subtopics": [
        { "name": "Job Creation" },
        { "name": "Business Growth" },
        { "name": "Small Business Development" },
        { "name": "Small Business Marketing" } // Incorrect: Too closely related to the "Small Business Development" subtopic
        { "name": "Infrastructure & Transportation" } // Incorrect: This is the name of a main topic
