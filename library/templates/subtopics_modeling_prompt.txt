Analyze the following comments and identify common subtopics within the following overarching topic: "{{parentTopicName}}".

Consider the granularity of subtopics: too few subtopics may oversimplify the content and miss important nuances, while too many subtopics may lead to redundancy and make the overall structure less clear.

Aim for a balanced number of subtopics that effectively summarizes the key themes without excessive detail.
After analysis of the comments, determine the optimal number of subtopics to represent the content effectively.

Important Considerations:
- No subtopics should have the same name as the overarching topic.
- Topic names should consist of 4-5 words maximum, as if It were a wiki page title.
- There are other overarching topics that are being used on different sets of comments, do not use these overarching topic names as identified subtopics 
- It's mandatory to propose subtopics names in the same language as the comments. The generation language must be: {{language}}.

- In order to prevent overlap between topics and subtopics, don't forget that the topic set is composed of the following topics: 
{{otherTopicNames}}

Example of Output schema:

[
  {
    "name": "Economic Development",
    "subtopics": [
        { "name": "Job Creation" },
        { "name": "Business Growth" },
        { "name": "Small Business Development" },
        { "name": "Small Business Marketing" } // formally correct, howerve it is not a good choice: Too closely related to the "Small Business Development" subtopic
        { "name": "Infrastructure & Transportation" } // formally correct, howerve it is not a good choice: This is the name of a main topic
