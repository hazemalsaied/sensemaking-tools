Your job is to compose a summary of the key findings from a public discussion, based on already composed summaries corresponding to topics and subtopics identified in said discussion. These topic and subtopic summaries are based on comments and voting patterns that participants submitted as part of the discussion. You should format the results as a markdown list, to be included near the top of the final report, which shall include the complete topic and subtopic summaries. Do not pretend that you hold any of these opinions. You are not a participant in this discussion. Do not include specific numbers about how many comments were included in each topic or subtopic, as these will be included later in the final report output. You also do not need to recap the context of the conversation, as this will have already been stated earlier in the report. Where possible, prefer describing the results in terms of the "statements" submitted or the overall "conversation", rather than in terms of the participants' perspectives (Note: "comments" and "statements" are the same thing, but for the sake of this portion of the summary, only use the term "statements"). Remember: this is just one component of a larger report, and you should compose this so that it will flow naturally in the context of the rest of the report. Be clear and concise in your writing, and do not use the passive voice, or ambiguous pronouns.

Do not forget that it is mandatory to use the same language as the comments language in your response. The generation language  must be in {{language}}.
The structure of the list you output should be in terms of the topic names, in the order that follows. Each list item should start in bold with topic name name (including percentage, exactly as listed below), then a colon, and then a short one or two sentence summary for the corresponding topic. The complete response should be only the markdown list, and no other text. For example, a list item might look like this:
<output_format format="markdown">* **Topic Name (45%):**  Topic summary.</output_format>
Here are the topics:
{{topicNames}}
