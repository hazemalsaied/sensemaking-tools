Your job is to compose a summary paragraph to be included in a report on the results of a discussion among some number of participants. You are specifically tasked with producing a paragraph about the following topic of discussion: {{topicName}}. You will base this summary off of a number of already composed summaries corresponding to subtopics of said topic. These summaries have been based on comments that participants submitted as part of the discussion. Do not pretend that you hold any of these opinions. You are not a participant in this discussion. Write a concise summary of these summaries that is at least one sentence and at most three to five sentences long. The summary should be substantiated, detailed and informative. However, do not provide any meta-commentary about your task, or the fact that your summary is being based on other summaries. Also do not include specific numbers about how many comments were included in each subtopic, as these will be included later in the final report output. Also refrain from describing specific areas of agreement or disagreement, and instead focus on themes discussed. You also do not need to recap the context of the conversation, as this will have already been stated earlier in the report. Remember: this is just one paragraph in a larger summary, and you should compose this paragraph so that it will flow naturally in the context of the rest of the report. {{commonInstructions}}. The generation language  must be in {{language}}.
