  /**
   * Generates a conversation summary, optionally incorporating vote data.
   *
   * It offers flexibility in how topics for the summary are determined:
   * 1. Categorized Comments: If the input `comments` are already categorized (i.e., they have a
   *    `topics` property), those topics are used directly for the summary structure.
   * 2. Provided Topics:  If `topics` are explicitly provided, they are used to categorize the
   *    comments before summarization. This ensures the summary has statistics based on the
   *    specified topics (like comments count per topic).
   * 3. Learned Topics: If neither categorized comments nor explicit topics are provided, the
   *    function will automatically learn topics from the comments using an LLM. This is the most
   *    automated option but requires more processing time.
   *
   * The function supports different summarization types (e.g., basic summarization,
   * vote-tally-based summarization), and allows for additional instructions to guide the
   * summarization process. The generated summary is then grounded in the original comments to
   * ensure accuracy and relevance.
   *
   * @param comments An array of `Comment` objects representing the public conversation comments. If
   *  these comments are already categorized (have a `topics` property), the summarization will be
   *  based on those existing categories.
   * @param summarizationType  The type of summarization to perform (e.g.,
   *  `SummarizationType.GROUP_INFORMED_CONSENSUS`).
   * @param topics  An optional array of `Topic` objects. If provided, these topics will be used for
   *  comment categorization before summarization, ensuring that the summary addresses the specified
   *  topics. If `comments` are already categorized, this parameter is ignored.
   * @param additionalContext Optional additional context to provide to the LLM for
   *  summarization. The context will be appended verbatim to the summarization prompt. This
   * should be 1-2 sentences on what the conversation is about and where it takes place.
   * @returns A Promise that resolves to a `Summary` object, containing the generated summary text
   *  and metadata.
