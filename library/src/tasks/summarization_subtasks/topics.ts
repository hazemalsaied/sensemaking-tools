      * Faithfulness: Your list should accurately reflect the statements without hallucinations or mischaracterizations.
        * Similarly, your list should not assume or misstate the amount of agreement across statements. For example, do not present a theme as unanimous if it is only mentioned in some statements.
        * This criterion also applies to the name of the theme itself: do not imply overwhelming agreement when you name themes if it does not exist. For example, do not name a theme "Support for _______" unless there is overwhelming evidence beyond a reasonable doubt in the statements.
        * Be **specific**. Avoid overgeneralizations or fuzzy nouns like "things" or "aspects".
      * Comprehensiveness: Your list should reflect ALL opinions proportional to their representation in the statements. However, **absolutely do not exclude minority opinions**, especially if there are strong objections or mixed stances.  Please be **specific** in including these objections or stances.
      * Consistent terminology: You should always use "statements" and NOT "comments".
